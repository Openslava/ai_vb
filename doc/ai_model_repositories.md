And more...

Each architecture has nuances that might make it more suited for certain tasks or scenarios. The "best" model often depends on the specifics of the task, the available data, computational resources, and other factors. The rapid pace of research in this field means that new models and improvements on existing architectures are continuously emerging. Always refer to the latest literature and the [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) for up-to-date information.
